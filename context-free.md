# Context Free

##  Who is this programming language for?

This programming language is probably meant for those who want to create digital
art or for exposing programming students to new and different languages.

## What is easy to do in this language? Why is it easy?

It is easy to create things using repetition and recursive functions. It is also
easy to create complicated pieces of _repetitive_ art with simple building blocks due to the 
way that you are able to breakdown the shapes.

## What is hard to do in this language? Why is it hard?

For complicated art with non-repetitive elements, using this language would be
inefficient and possibly difficult because it would require a lot of rules and 
different shapes that you could not re-use. 

## How did you learn how to program in this language?

I did a lot of experimentation after looking through the example given and the
documentation.

## What is the underlying _computational model_ for this programming language? 
_We don't yet have a great definition of the term "computational model". 
For now, try to come up with the clearest, most concise explanation of what 
happens when a ContextFree program runs._

The drawing is started by the `startshape` command, and from there the computer
executes the rules defined by the program. I'm guessing that, like its name, it
acts like a context-free grammar to interpret the program where elementry shapes
are terminals.

## What do you think is interesting about the ContextFree program you wrote?

I played around a lot with the values for the colors and sizes as well as the 
loops for the context free program I wrote. I like the final result, especially 
the combination of colors and the abstractness of it. However, I think that the
most interesting part of my program was learning the language itself and playing
around with the different and new aspects of context free.
