# Context Free

##  Who is this programming language for?

Anyone who wishes to design artwork using code.

## What is easy to do in this language? Why is it easy?

Designing art can be very difficult. It's easy to create shapes in this 
without having to worry about details.

## What is hard to do in this language? Why is it hard?

Individual shapes or rules do not have identifiers, so I could not 
easily place additional shapes. Each shape had to be tweaked in regard 
to its x and y placement.

## How did you learn how to program in this language?

I learned through examples. I went through many of the pieces of artwork 
in the gallery and learned syntax and features from them. I also read 
through some of the basic documentation.

## What is the underlying _computational model_ for this programming language? 
_We don't yet have a great definition of the term "computational model". 
For now, try to come up with the clearest, most concise explanation of what 
happens when a ContextFree program runs._



## What do you think is interesting about the ContextFree program you wrote?

The program is based off the Pythagorean theorem.
