# Context Free

##  Who is this programming language for?
Mainly for artist with some programming experience and understanding of recursion. 

## What is easy to do in this language? Why is it easy?
Learning about recursion can be done pretty easily using Context Free, but also creating very dynamic and random images is very easy. Particularly easy because randomness and recursion are very promoted and simple in the language.

## What is hard to do in this language? Why is it hard?
Getting more concrete details that don't build on themselves can be a bit difficult. Mainly because the specific function of this language is to build things recursively. 

## How did you learn how to program in this language?
Watched a video tutorial on Youtube, looked at a few of the examples within the program, then trial and error. Experimented to see what different things did when put together. 

## What is the underlying _computational model_ for this programming language? 
_We don't yet have a great definition of the term "computational model". 
For now, try to come up with the clearest, most concise explanation of what 
happens when a ContextFree program runs._

Context Free takes in a set of different descriptions that are combined to create images. Starts with a root shape that is used as the first instance of the image. The rest of the image is built upon the definition of this shape, which can be built with smaller elements of itself, or from other shapes defined. The description, from what the Context Free website says, is in the form of a context free grammar and is saved in a .cfdg file.  

## What do you think is interesting about the ContextFree program you wrote?

The most interesting thing I see is how recursion works with the colors, and the overall effect of the rapid changes in color with the plain black background. It's not something that would be very easy to do by hand or with other programs.
