# Context Free

##  Who is this programming language for?

Honestly, I'm not sure. It's probably more useful for teaching grammar and rules than for its incredibly intuitive method of drawing.


## What is easy to do in this language? Why is it easy?

Recursive drawing is easy, since rules are made to be embedded. This means anything of a fractal nature should be straight forward.


## What is hard to do in this language? Why is it hard?

Visualizing what will happen is very difficult. Partly because of the inherent recursiveness, it's difficult to see where the objects will end up more than one or two steps down the line. The syntax is also very optuse. The parameters are described by single letters and the numbers given to them are less than intuitive as well.


## How did you learn how to program in this language?

I skimmed some documentation, then took some simple examples from the app and some more complex examples from the gallery. From these I tweeked parameters until I had a greater grasp of what they did. I then messed with making my own shapes because I wanted to avoid the squares and circles.


## What is the underlying _computational model_ for this programming language? 
_We don't yet have a great definition of the term "computational model". 
For now, try to come up with the clearest, most concise explanation of what 
happens when a ContextFree program runs._

The first rule is run, and each other rule is called upon as it comes up. Once user-defined rules for where to put what are processed, the drawing itself gets altered with more basic constructs that have been altered and specified at higher levels.


## What do you think is interesting about the ContextFree program you wrote?

I'm not sure. I enjoyed with messing around to make my own polygons, and then thought they looked like stars or snowflakes, so I went from there.
