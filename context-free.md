# Context Free

##  Who is this programming language for?
This programming language is used to create digital art. It also contains
support for conditionals and loops so it could theoretically be used as a
more general purpose language.

## What is easy to do in this language? Why is it easy?
In this language it is exceptionally easy to iteratively create large and
complicated images by building up from smaller ones. This is because of the
way the language is designed. By its nature, the language starts with a
basic shape and uses grammar rules to build copies of that shape into a
more complicated one.
I actually wouldn't go as far as to say creating art is easy to do in this
language. Even within the area of "art", ContextFree lends itself to a certian
type of art, focused on the repetition of geometric shapes.

## What is hard to do in this language? Why is it hard?
I found that it was really hard to create an image after visualizing it. It's
incredibly tedious to manually draw out an image using the line drawing
utilities, so if you can't think of a way to express what you're trying
to create iteratively with geometric shapes you're out of luck. Again, this
is due to the way the language is designed, if it was designed to interface
with a GUI that allowed free form drawing, then it would be much easier to
create complicated images without iteration.
It goes without saying that doing anything besides art in this language
would be incredibly difficult.

## How did you learn how to program in this language?
I learned how to program in this language using the tutorials found
[here](http://contextfreeart.org/mediawiki/index.php/CFDG_HOWTO)
and [here](http://www.magicandlove.com/blog/2010/08/29/context-free-art-tutorial-1/)

## What is the underlying _computational model_ for this programming language?
According to the context free website the contextFree computational model starts
with the startshape (and other basic shapes), and using the grammar rules that
make up the language builds up a sentence of shape. One there exists a complete
list of the symbols in the image, they can be rendered.

## What do you think is interesting about the ContextFree program you wrote?
I think it looks cool. To be honest the thing I like the most about ContextFree
is the "randomness" of it. Once you set up some kind of basic recursive structure
any kind of small change to the variables sets off a huge chain reaction that
turns what you had into a completely different image. I started off trying to
create a multicolored-tree, but I ended up with a weird circle instead of a root.
I kind of just added layers to that to create the "sun", which has some
interesting fractal patterns. I also think the picture evokes a sunrise without
explicitly displaying it which is cool.
