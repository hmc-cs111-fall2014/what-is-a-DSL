# Context Free

##  Who is this programming language for?
For people who want to create computer art. It seems to be for artists who want a lot of control over what they are making, as only very basic shapes exists and so everything you would want to make needs to be custom designed.

## What is easy to do in this language? Why is it easy?
It is easy to create visual shapes, as you can simply define the shape into existence and then describe parameters on how it should look. It is easy because the language syntax is dedicated toward creating shapes, and the execution automatically shows you what you are making. It is also very easy to do recursive shapes/designs rather than hand-coding/drawing each shape, as they allow looping and recursive constructs.

## What is hard to do in this language? Why is it hard?
It is harder to quickly put what you are thinking visually into code. While it seems every shape/design is doable in Context Free, some require more thought than it might be to simply free-hand a shape. It is hard because everything is written in code, which for some abstract/less pattern oriented art, it can be more difficult to imagine how it should be described in code.

## How did you learn how to program in this language?
I looked at the "documentation", which was just an introduction describing the difference between version 2 and 3, and I looked at some art in the gallery to see what is possible, although didn't look into the code they used to create their art.

## What is the underlying _computational model_ for this programming language? 
_We don't yet have a great definition of the term "computational model". 
For now, try to come up with the clearest, most concise explanation of what 
happens when a ContextFree program runs._

I would assume there is some underlying Cartesian coordinate system to describe what should be at each point/pixel, and for each shape definition, there are functions for circle, square, etc. in how they should generated with regards to the parameters. As the function is being computed, corresponding pixels are filled in with the visual parameters of color, brightness, etc.


## What do you think is interesting about the ContextFree program you wrote?
I think what is interesting is the mix of recursive programming with the cycling of shapes as the background, in conjunction with the more "hard-coded" letters "DSL" which required more incremental testing to ensure that it turned out good.
