# Language
_What is the name of the language? Link the name to its webpage 
(if appropriate)._
The DSL I will be discussing is the Wiki Markup Language, a reference to which can be found at the [help page] (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Help:Wiki_markup).


# Domain
_Describe the language's domain in five words._


# Computational model
_What is the underlying computational model of this language? To answer this 
question, provide a high-level description (no more than 100 words) of the 
computation that occurs when someone executes a program in this language._


# DSL-ness
_Fowler writes about a spectrum of languages, from general-purpose languages to 
"purely" domain-specific. Where does the DSL you chose fall on this spectrum, 
and why?_ 


# Internal or external?
_Is the language implemented as an internal or external DSL? 
Justify your answer._


# Host language
_What language(s) was (were) used to implement the DSL?_


# Benefits
_Identify one potential benefit of the DSL: how is a programmer's life or a 
company's bottom line made easier by the existence of this language?_


# Drawbacks
_Identify one potential drawback of the DSL: what does a programmer or company 
lose by using this DSL instead of a general-purpose language?_
