# Language
_What is the name of the language? Link the name to its webpage 
(if appropriate)._

   The name of the language is [Csound](http://www.csounds.com/).

# Domain
_Describe the language's domain in five words._

   Modular and extensible audio programming.

# Computational model
_What is the underlying computational model of this language? To answer this 
question, provide a high-level description (no more than 100 words) of the 
computation that occurs when someone executes a program in this language._

   Unit generators (also known as opcodes) use predefined arrays of values that describe waveforms of specific frequencies to define the sound. If the waveform is not predefined, the unit generator using the function for that waveform to determined the values.


# DSL-ness
_Fowler writes about a spectrum of languages, from general-purpose languages to 
"purely" domain-specific. Where does the DSL you chose fall on this spectrum, 
and why?_ 


# Internal or external?
_Is the language implemented as an internal or external DSL? 
Justify your answer._


# Host language
_What language(s) was (were) used to implement the DSL?_


# Benefits
_Identify one potential benefit of the DSL: how is a programmer's life or a 
company's bottom line made easier by the existence of this language?_


# Drawbacks
_Identify one potential drawback of the DSL: what does a programmer or company 
lose by using this DSL instead of general-purpose language?_
